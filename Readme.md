# making virtual enviroment
# now goona to understand from strach everything

## difference bw mutable and immutable

- so mutable values can change but their adress of memory will be remain same if a new object is created
- but in immutable the game is changer here when you wanna to make a new object then its memory adress is change 
- donot check the changes with values check with identity


- numbers  , booleans  ,  real   , complex numbers  , and  , or  , not operators
- done strings , index , slices
- tuples , membership testing 
- lists 
- operator overloading and byte array 
- dictionary 
- sets

## Conditional done
- study about if else
- then also mutilpe conditions with elif and also with ternery which is so amazing
- also use case and match

## loops
- for loop
- while loop
- break and continue
- walrus operator


## functions 
- local and global scope
- how to handle multiple params
- detail overview of function
- handling params
- multilple args
- diff bw args and  keyward args
- anonymous functions
- recursion
- pure vs impure 
- import , modules , and init file

### comprehensions
- is the concise way of writing code for creating list sets dictionary and generator in python using signle line of code 

- types lists , sets, generator , dictionary 

#### List => 
- list are represent in below format
- [expression for item in iterable if condition]

- sets
- dictionary


### OOP
- object oriented programming
- Class
- object
- namespace
- Attributes Shadowing
- methods
- constructor
- deeply cover inheritence
- how we access base class we use 3 method
    - explicit call
    - super()
    - code duplication
- static method and class method
- getter , setter , property decoder


### Error Handling
- we use try except to handle errors
- finally  , if , else used to handle keywards


### working with asyncio async await
- all code will exectue in non blocking io
- study about event loop which will be really amazing 



# Study About Pydantic
- pydantic is python library used for schema validation and data modeling

# field and model validators and computed field
- we use validators to make custom logics
- filed validators use to check one value
- model validator use to check two fileds
- computed field actually used to give calcaulated values
- Advance validations
- nested models
- serailization

### to make virtual enviroment = python -m venv venv
### to active window script = venv\Scripts\activate
### to start server : uvicorn prac:app
